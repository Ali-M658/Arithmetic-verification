"""T4: sharpness witnesses. K_mult >= n needs two distinct n-cone hyperbolic
multisets sharing the first n-1 invariants (R, S1, P3, ..., P_{2n-5}).

Part A re-verifies the known witnesses exactly:
    n = 3: {2,8,8} vs {3,3,12}          share (R, S1)
    n = 4: {3,10,15,30} vs {4,5,21,28}   share (R, S1, P3)
and checks the pair criterion of proof.md (section 4): with p(z) = prod(z+m_i),
    Phi(z) := p(z) p'(-z) - p'(z) p(-z) = kappa z^3,  kappa != 0.

Part B is an exhaustive n = 5 search: every multiset 2 <= m_1 <= ... <= m_5 <= N
(all are hyperbolic, since sum(1 - 1/m_i) >= 5/2 > 2), grouped by S1 = sum m_i
(a shared invariant), keyed on the exact integer tuple (P3, P5, L*R) with
L = lcm(2..N). The key is exact, not a hash digest. As a control the same pass
records (R, S1, P3) collisions, i.e. the n = 5 failures of three coefficients.

Part C (cross-n): 3-cone vs 4-cone orbifolds with orders <= min(N, 60) sharing
the first three heat coefficients (a 3-cone orbifold is a 4-multiset padded
with the invisible order 1).

usage: sharpness_search.py [N]   (default N = 60; writes sharpness_n5_N<N>.json)
Exits nonzero on any failed assertion.
