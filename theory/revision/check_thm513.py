"""Task 5(b) (G7-4b): the collision-free sums of Theorem 5.13, as a checkable certificate.

A sum S "carries a collision" if two distinct hyperbolic triads p <= q <= r (1/p+1/q+1/r < 1) with
p+q+r = S have the same reciprocal sum R.  Claim (thm513.tex): for 18 <= S <= 4800 exactly the 38 sums
    19 21 22 23 24 25 27 28 29 30 33 41 44 46 47 48 49 50 51 59 65 67 81 99 115 119 123 125
    173 199 203 223 235 243 251 307 329 557
carry no collision; also no S <= 17 carries one.

  (a) for every S <= 17 and every listed S: exhaustive enumeration of the hyperbolic triads of sum S,
      reciprocal sums compared as exact fractions -- all distinct                         [exact]
  (b) for every other S in [18, 4800]: a witness pair, taken from the committed enumeration
      review/audit/diophantine/enum_4800.txt (first class listed at S) and re-verified here from
      scratch: two distinct sorted triads, both of sum S, both hyperbolic, equal R          [exact]
  (c) the witnesses are also produced independently of that file for every S whose witness is a
      scaled copy: if d | S and d has a witness, (S/d) x witness is one at S; the remaining
      ("primitive") sums are listed with their witnesses in check_thm513.txt
