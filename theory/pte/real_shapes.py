"""Real solvability of the size-8, L = 3 system by shape (proof.md section 6, item 3).

For shape (p, q) with p + q = 8, choose q - 3 + ... : we fix the q-element side V at random (positive reals)
and solve for the p-element side when p = 3 (closed form: U = roots of t^3 - S t^2 + R e3 t - e3,
e3 = (C - S^3)/(3(1 - S R))), counting how often U consists of three positive reals.
For shapes (2,6) and (1,7) the same elimination is impossible by Theorem 2.1 (|iota| <= T - 2L = 2);
we confirm numerically that a least-squares solver never reaches a genuine solution of those shapes.
Floating point is used only to *exhibit* real solutions; nothing proved depends on it.
Deterministic (fixed seeds).  Run time about 30 s.
