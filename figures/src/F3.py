"""F3 (Section 3): the mirror argument of Theorem S on one real axis.

For two signatures with equal area, pad the order multisets with 1s to U, V (Lemma 4) and put
Z = U* (+) (-V*) after cancelling common elements. Equal c_1, ..., c_L means
R(U*) = R(V*) and P_j(U*) = P_j(V*) for odd j <= 2L-3, i.e. sum_{z in Z} z^j = 0 for those j and
sum 1/z = 0. If |Z| <= 2L these force Q(z) = prod (z - x) to be even, so Z is symmetric under
z -> -z; since U*, V* are disjoint, both are empty and the signatures coincide.

Filled discs: Z (positive side U*, negative side -V*; stacked for multiplicity). Open rings: the
mirror image -Z. Symmetry means every ring sits on a disc.
(a) top:    (2,8,8) against (3,3,12): Z = {2,8,8,-3,-3,-12}, |Z| = 6, they share exactly
            2 = |Z|/2 - 1 coefficients; no ring sits on a disc.
    bottom: the configuration the theorem forces once |Z| <= 2L: Z = -Z (shown for (2,8,8)
            against itself, before cancellation), every ring on a disc.
(b) (1;15) against (0;3,3,5,5): U = {1,15} (one padding 1), V = {3,3,5,5}; the sides differ by
    |V| - |U| = 2 = 2(g - g'), the genus difference; they share exactly 2 coefficients.

Asserted with theory/signatures/sig_common.py: the number of shared coefficients (from the
actual cone coefficients b_l), the padding, the vanishing sums of 1/z and z over Z, and the
first non-vanishing odd power sum.
