"""
Exact enumeration of hyperbolic n-cone spherical orbifolds.

An n-cone pillow O(m_1, ..., m_n) is the 2-sphere carrying n cone points of
orders 2 <= m_1 <= ... <= m_n. It is hyperbolic when

    sum_i (1 - 1/m_i) > 2,

equivalently when its orbifold Euler characteristic is negative. For n = 3 this
reduces exactly to the manuscript's condition 1/p + 1/q + 1/r < 1.

Everything here is exact: integers and fractions.Fraction only, never a float.
The module is stdlib-only by design -- it is the arithmetic floor the rest of
the harness stands on, so it must not inherit a third-party dependency.

Written to be reused unchanged at n = 4 and n = 5. Nothing is specialised to
triples: no triple is hardcoded anywhere in this file.

AREA CONVENTION
---------------
Gauss-Bonnet for a closed 2-orbifold gives

    Area(O) = -2*pi*chi_orb(O),        chi_orb(O) = 2 - sum_i (1 - 1/m_i).

For n = 3 this is Area = 2*pi*(1 - R) with R = sum_i 1/m_i, which is the
manuscript's eq:area. A superseded upstream script used Area = pi*(1 - R),
wrong by a factor of two; `selftest()` below asserts against that error
directly.

Area is returned as an exact rational multiple of pi -- the coefficient of pi,
not a float -- so `area_over_pi` is the honest name and no rounding enters.
