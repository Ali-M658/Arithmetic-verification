"""D1 (referee round 1, reviewers b m9, c m6, d m6a): recount the pencil witnesses of Remark 3.2.

    python3 review/round1-fixes/d1_pencil_counts.py [N ...]      defaults 130 220 (about 3 minutes)

Definition used (and printed in the revised paper). A *pencil splitting* of bound N is a pair
(A, B) of 4-multisets of nonzero integers, all entries of absolute value at most N, with
  e_1(A) = e_1(B) = 0,  e_3(A) = e_3(B),  e_4(A) = e_4(B),  A != B,
such that Z = A + (-B) (multiset union) has four positive and four negative entries and no pair
{z, -z}. Its *witness* is the pair {U, V}, U = Z_{>0}, V = -Z_{<0}: two disjoint 4-multisets of
positive integers with equal R, P_1, P_3 (so equal first three heat invariants as spheres with four
cone points). We count distinct witnesses {U, V} (unordered), all of them and the primitive ones
(gcd of the eight orders equal to 1), and check each witness exactly: equal R, P_1, P_3, different
P_5, every order >= 2.

Independent of theory/pte: the enumeration of A is written anew (numpy, exact int64 keys, then
exact Python integers for every candidate pair). Writes review/round1-fixes/output/d1_pencil_N<N>.csv
and prints the counts.
