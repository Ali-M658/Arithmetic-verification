# G5-bis audit: statements under review, group `stability`

Stability: Proposition 6.10 (explicit remainder formulas) and re-certification of every printed delta

Every result below is copied verbatim, by line range, from its source file (`review/audit-2/build_statements.py`
asserts the anchors and that no proof text is included). Items marked COMPOSED combine verbatim excerpts with
connective text in [square brackets]. **Proofs, scripts and data of the sessions that produced these results are
deliberately withheld.** You must not open any file of `theory/pte/`, `theory/revision/`, `theory/signatures/`
(other than where stated below), `review/referee-sim/` or `paper/` (the manuscript contains proofs of some of these
results). If you do open one by accident, say so in your REVIEW.md under 'contamination'.



## Context files you may read (previously audited statements, no proofs)

- review/audit/statements/stability.md  (ST.0 setting and recovery map, ST.12 Proposition S5, ST.13, ST.14 the printed results table). Everything you need for the setting and the printed values is in the verbatim excerpts below.

## External inputs

- None external. The only task-specific facts are the notation and formulas of the excerpts. Exact rational arithmetic only (fractions.Fraction or sympy). Floating point is not a certificate.

## Fetched sources

Texts fetched headlessly by `review/audit-2/fetch_sources.sh` are in `review/audit-2/sources/` (not committed).
Never quote a source from memory: quote the fetched text, with page or section. An unreachable source is an
instrument gap, to be logged, not a confirmation.

## 1. Setting and the recovery map

Conventions (`numerics/REPORT.md` §2; `theory/cone-coefficients/ucar-source.md`): positive
Laplacian, K = κ = −1, and

- H₋₁ = Area/(4π) = (n − 2 − R)/2;
- H_ν = (Area/4π)·α_{ν+1} + Σ_i b_ν(m_i) for ν ≥ 0;
- b_ν(m) = (−1)^ν p_ν(m)/m, with p_ν = Σ_k π_{ν,k} m^{2k} even of degree 2ν + 2 and
  p_ν(1) = 0 (Uçar (4.25)+(4.33));
- α_j = a_j^{sm}/vol (Uçar (4.35)): α = 1, −1/3, 1/15, −4/315, 1/315, …

The smooth coefficients α_j are also derived independently from the Selberg identity term
(`stab_common.alpha_smooth_selberg`), and the two agree for j ≤ 11.

The number n of cone points is assumed known. The **recovery map** studied throughout is:

1. **Front end.** Ĩ := L⁻¹(H̃ − h₀).
2. **Linear solve.** ẽ := M(Ĩ)⁻¹ b(Ĩ) (Theorem B).
3. **Roots.** Take the roots of q̃(z) := Σ_{j=0}^{n}(−1)^j ẽ_j z^{n−j}, with ẽ₀ = 1.
4. **Rounding** (integer orders only). Round the real part of every root.

Throughout, μ := max_i m_i. Hats denote scale-free quantities:

- m̂ = m/μ ∈ (0,1]ⁿ and ê_k = e_k/μ^k;
- Î = (μR, P₁/μ, P₃/μ³, …).

Theorem B's system is weighted-homogeneous: row j has weight 2j+1, the last row weight n−1,
and column k weight k. Hence M(Î) = D_r⁻¹ M(I) D_c, and ê solves M(Î) ê = b(Î).
Distances between multisets are optimal matching distances,
d(m, m′) = min_π max_i |m_i − m′_{π(i)}|.

The first rows of L⁻¹, which give I = L⁻¹(H − h₀):

| | H₋₁ | H₀ | H₁ | H₂ | H₃ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R | −2 | | | | |
| P₁ | 2 | 12 | | | |
| P₃ | −18 | −120 | −360 | | |
| P₅ | 30 | 252 | 1260 | 2520 | |
| P₇ | −70/3 | −240 | −1680 | −6720 | −10080 |

**Amplification.** With every |δH_ν| ≤ δ, the worst-case error in I_r is ℓ_r·δ, where ℓ_r is
the absolute row sum of L⁻¹. Row r involves only the first r+1 coefficients, so ℓ_r is the
same for every n:

| | R | P₁ | P₃ | P₅ | P₇ | P₉ | P₁₁ | P₁₃ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| diagonal 1/\|L_rr\| | 2 | 12 | 360 | 2520 | 10080 | 28512 | 43243200/691 | 112320 |
| ℓ_r (row sum) | 2 | 14 | 498 | 4062 | 56230/3 | 303654/5 | 104899830/691 | 10805786/35 |

**Correction to the review (DEFECTS.md MAJ-05).**

- The factors 12, 360, 2520 are correct as the diagonal entries of L⁻¹: for P₁ from H₀, P₃
  from H₁ and P₅ from H₂.
- They are not the amplification factors. Each invariant also inherits the errors of all
  lower coefficients through the off-diagonal entries, e.g.
  δP₃ = −18 δH₋₁ − 120 δH₀ − 360 δH₁.
- So the worst-case factors are **14, 498, 4062**, larger by 1.17, 1.38 and 1.61.
- R is recovered from H₋₁ with factor 2. Equivalently, R = n − 2 − Area/(2π), so the factor
  is 1/(2π) per unit of area.
- In relative terms the front end is harmless. The ratio
  κ_r = Σ_c |(L⁻¹)_{rc}| |H_c| / |I_r| lies between 0.02 and 3.7 on every test multiset of
  `front_end_output.md`. For (2,8,8) it is 0.33, 0.94, 1.33 for R, P₁, P₃.

**Lemma S2.2 (Hurwitz factorisation of M).** Let f(z) = ∏(1 + m_i z) = E(z²) + zO(z²), and for
D(z) = Σ_{k=1}^n d_k z^k let W_D := E_f O_D − E_D O_f, a polynomial in w = z² of degree ≤ n−1.
Define two n × n matrices (with e_i := 0 outside 0 ≤ i ≤ n):

- B_{k,j} = (−1)^{j+1} e_{2k+1−j}, for 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ n. This is the map
  d ↦ (coefficients of W_D).
- S_{k,i} = e_{2(k−i)} for i ≤ k ≤ n−2, S_{n−1,n−1} = (−1)ⁿ e_n, and all other entries 0.

  B = S·M,  det B = (−1)^{n(n−1)/2} ∏_{i<j}(m_i+m_j),  M⁻¹ = B⁻¹ S.

### ST.5. Theorem S2

Source: `theory/stability/proof.md` lines 196-222 (verbatim).

````
**Theorem S2 (Lipschitz dependence of e on I_n, explicit constants).**

*Setting.* Let m be positive reals and μ = max m_i. Let Ĩ be any real data vector with
scale-free error

  η := max( μ|R̃ − R|, max_{1≤l≤n−1} |P̃_{2l−1} − P_{2l−1}| / μ^{2l−1} ) ≤ 1.

*Constants.* Put κ := ‖M(Î)⁻¹‖_∞ and

- σ_k(n) := [w^k] artanh(w) · sec²((n+1) artanh w). For instance σ₁ = 1 and
  σ₃ = 1/3 + (n+1)²; n = 3: (1, 49/3); n = 4: (1, 76/3, 6628/15).
- ζ_n := max(1, max_{0≤j≤n−2} Σ_{0≤i<j, 2≤2j−2i≤n} σ_{2i+1}(n)). For example ζ₃ = 1,
  ζ₄ = 79/3, ζ₅ = 14048/15.
- ρ_n(m̂) := max( ê_n, max_{0≤j≤n−2} Σ_{i=0}^{j} σ_{2i+1}(n) ê_{2j−2i} ).

*Conclusions.*

(a) The inverse is bounded by

  κ ≤ n Λ(m̂) ‖Ŝ‖_∞ / ∏_{i<j}(m̂_i + m̂_j) ≤ n · binom(2n,n)^{n/2} · 2^{n−1} / ∏_{i<j}(m̂_i + m̂_j),

  where Λ(m̂) = ∏_c ‖c-th column of B(ê)‖₂ and ‖Ŝ‖_∞ ≤ max(Σ_{k even} ê_k, ê_n).

(b) If β := κ ζ_n η ≤ 1/2, then M(Ĩ) is invertible, and ẽ = M(Ĩ)⁻¹ b(Ĩ) satisfies

  max_k |ẽ_k − e_k| / μ^k ≤ 2 κ ρ_n(m̂) η.

### ST.6. Ostrowski input as quoted

Source: `theory/stability/proof.md` lines 264-273 (verbatim).

````
**Standard global theorem (fetched, `review/literature/root-perturbation.md`).** Ostrowski,
*Acta Math.* 72 (1940), Théorème XXX, eq. (71,1), p. 212, read from the primary. For monic
f, g of degree n with roots x_ν and y_ν, after renumbering,

  |y_ν − x_ν| ≤ (2n−1)ε,  ε = (Σ_{ν=1}^{n} |a_ν − b_ν| γ^{n−ν})^{1/n},

where γ is the largest root modulus. "Les racines … satisfont … à une condition de Lipschitz
d'ordre 1/n." This is uniform but crude: exponent 1/n everywhere, with no use of
separation. The local statement below has the exponent 1/k at a k-fold root, and is
Lipschitz at simple roots, with explicit constants.

### ST.7. Lemma S3

Source: `theory/stability/proof.md` lines 275-287 (verbatim).

````
**Lemma S3 (clusters, explicit Rouché).** Work in scale-free variables. Let
q(z) = ∏(z − m̂_i) = Σ_j (−1)^j ê_j z^{n−j}, and let q̃ be the same polynomial with ẽ in place
of ê, where |ẽ_j − ê_j| ≤ ε. Let a be a distinct value among the m̂_i, of multiplicity k, and
put

- g_a := min_{b≠a} |a − b| (∞ if there is no other value);
- Q_a := ∏_{b≠a} |a − b|^{k_b}.

If 0 < r ≤ min(g_a, 1)/2 and r^k Q_a ≥ 2^{1−k} 3ⁿ ε, then q̃ has exactly k zeros in |z − a| < r.
In particular, for r_a(ε) := (2^{1−k}3ⁿ ε/Q_a)^{1/k}, whenever r_a(ε) ≤ min(g_a, 1)/2, the k
roots of the cluster lie within r_a(ε) = O(ε^{1/k}) of a. The bound is Lipschitz for simple
orders, where Q_a = |q′(a)|.

### ST.8. Theorem S3

Source: `theory/stability/proof.md` lines 301-321 (verbatim).

````
**Theorem S3 (heat coefficients → orders; the combined stability theorem).**

*Setting.* Let m be positive reals, n = |m|, μ = max m_i. Let H̃ be data with
δ := max_{−1≤ν≤n−2} |H̃_ν − H_ν(m)|. Put

- λ_μ := max(μ ℓ₀, max_{1≤r≤n−1} ℓ_r μ^{1−2r}), with ℓ = (2, 14, 498, 4062, …) as in §2;
- κ, ρ_n, ζ_n as in Theorem S2.

*Statement.* Suppose λ_μ δ ≤ 1 and κ ζ_n λ_μ δ ≤ 1/2. Then for every distinct order a, of
multiplicity k_a, with

  r_a := μ · (2^{2−k_a} 3ⁿ κ ρ_n λ_μ δ / Q̂_a)^{1/k_a} ≤ μ · min(ĝ_a, 1)/2,

the recovered polynomial q̃ has exactly k_a roots within r_a of a. Consequently, if the
radius hypothesis holds for **every** distinct order a,

  d(roots of q̃, m) ≤ max_a C_a δ^{1/k_a},  C_a = μ (2^{2−k_a} 3ⁿ κ ρ_n λ_μ / Q̂_a)^{1/k_a}.

So recovery is Lipschitz with constant C_a at simple orders, where Q̂_a = |q̂′(â)| measures the
gaps, and Hölder with exponent 1/k at a k-fold coincidence.

### ST.12. Proposition S5 (statement of the two tests)

Source: `theory/stability/proof.md` lines 378-408 (verbatim).

````
**Proposition S5 (certificates, exact arithmetic).**

*Input.* Fix m and componentwise radii ρ_ν ≥ 0. Every data vector with |H̃_ν − H_ν(m)| ≤ ρ_ν
is recovered exactly if either test below succeeds, with all quantities evaluated in
rational arithmetic (`threshold.py`).

*Common part.*

1. |δI| ≤ |L⁻¹|ρ.
2. Bound |δT_k| ≤ (|sech²U| ∗ |δU|)_k + [z^k](tan(U+|δU|) − tan U − sec²U·|δU|). The first
   term is the exact linear part. The second is the coefficientwise majorant of the
   remainder, valid because U ≥ 0.
3. Form the residual bound |r|, the bound |δM|, and A := |M⁻¹||δM|.
4. Certify ρ(A) < 1 by checking that v = (I − A)⁻¹𝟙 > 0.
5. Then |ẽ − e| ≤ E := (I − A)⁻¹|M⁻¹||r|.

*(i) Componentwise test.* For each distinct order a, some radius r ∈ {1/2, 19/40, …, 1/40,
1/100, 1/1000} satisfies

  r^{k_a} ∏_{b≠a}(|a−b| − r)^{k_b} > Σ_j E_j (a + r)^{n−j}.

*(ii) Coherent test.* Write ẽ − e = G·δH + ϱ, where:

- G = (D_I e) L⁻¹ is exact (Lemma S2.1);
- |ϱ| ≤ |M⁻¹||r_rem| + A E, with r_rem the remainder part of r.

On |z − a| = r, bound the first-order part through the exact Taylor coefficients at a of
the polynomials p_c(z) = Σ_j (−1)^j G_{jc} z^{n−j}. The test is

  r^{k_a} ∏(|a−b| − r)^{k_b} > Σ_c ρ_c Σ_l |p_c^{(l)}(a)/l!| r^l + Σ_j |ϱ_j| (a + r)^{n−j}.

### SB.2. Proposition 6.10: notation and the explicit formulas (steps 1-3, J)

Source: `theory/revision/prop610.tex` lines 14-16; `theory/revision/prop610.tex` lines 20-48 (verbatim).

````
Write $\cI=(R,P_1,P_3,\dots,P_{2n-3})$, indexed $\cI_0=R$ and $\cI_k=P_{2k-1}$, and
$U(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}P_{2k-1}z^{2k-1}/(2k-1)$; all power series are truncated after $z^{2n-3}$, and
$e_k=0$ for $k>n$. Write $\operatorname{sech}^2U=1-T^2=\sum_ks_kz^k$, $T=\tanh U$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item Put $\Delta=|\mathbf F^{-1}|\,\delta$, so $|\tilde\cI_k-\cI_k|\le\Delta_k$, and
  $|\delta U|(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\Delta_kz^{2k-1}/(2k-1)$.
\item Put
  \[
    \tau^{\rm lin}=|\operatorname{sech}^2U|*|\delta U|,\qquad
    \tau^{\rm rem}=\tan(U+|\delta U|)-\tan U-\sec^2U\cdot|\delta U|,\qquad
    \tau=\tau^{\rm lin}+\tau^{\rm rem},
  \]
  coefficientwise; then $|\tilde T_k-T_k|\le\tau_k$, and the part of $\tilde T_k-T_k$ beyond first order
  in $\delta\cI$ is at most $\tau^{\rm rem}_k$ in absolute value.
\item Put, for $0\le j\le n-2$,
  \[
    \rho_j=\sum_{i=0}^{j}\tau_{2i+1}\,e_{2j-2i},\qquad
    \rho^{\rm rem}_j=\sum_{i=0}^{j}\tau^{\rm rem}_{2i+1}\,e_{2j-2i},
  \]
  and $\rho_{n-1}=\Delta_0e_n$, $\rho^{\rm rem}_{n-1}=0$. Let $\Delta_M$ be the $n\times n$ matrix, rows
  indexed by $0\le j\le n-1$ and columns by the unknowns $e_1,\dots,e_n$, with entry $\tau_{2i+1}$ in
  row $j$, column $e_{2j-2i}$, for $0\le i<j\le n-2$ and $2j-2i\le n$; entry $\Delta_0$ in row $n-1$,
  column $e_n$; and zero elsewhere. Then $|r|\le\rho$, $|r_{\rm rem}|\le\rho^{\rm rem}$ and
  $|\delta M|\le\Delta_M$ entrywise. Put $A=|M^{-1}|\Delta_M$.
\end{enumerate}
Steps 4 and 5 are unchanged, with $\rho$ in place of $|r|$. In test (ii), $|\varrho|\le|M^{-1}|\rho^{\rm rem}+AE$
and $G=-M^{-1}J\,\mathbf F^{-1}$, where $J=\partial(Me-b)/\partial\cI$ at fixed $e$ is
\[
  J_{j,k}=-\frac1{2k-1}\sum_{\substack{k-1\le i\le j\\2j-2i\le n}}e_{2j-2i}\,s_{2i+2-2k}\quad(0\le j\le n-2,\ 1\le k\le n-1),
  \qquad J_{n-1,0}=-e_n,

### ST.13. Upper bound by construction; rounding convention

Source: `theory/stability/proof.md` lines 413-429 (verbatim).

````
**Upper bound by construction.** For each order a, the search minimises
‖H(q̃) − H(m)‖_∞ over real monic polynomials of two shapes:

- q̃ = (z − c) g(z), with a real root at c = a ± 1/2;
- q̃ = ((z − c)² + y²) g(z), with a complex pair of real part c = a ± 1/2.

The optimiser is numerical. The reported minimiser is rebuilt exactly in rationals, and its
data are evaluated exactly. Its recovery is q̃ itself (Theorem B, checked by an exact solve),
and that q̃ has a root with real part exactly a ± 1/2. At that point rounding is a tie, so
δ_up is an infimum: arbitrarily small further perturbations push the root across, and
recovery fails at every level above δ_up. Hence the true threshold is at most δ_up.

*Rounding of printed values.* δ_thm and δ_cert are printed rounded **down**, and δ_up
rounded **up**, so that each printed number keeps its meaning. An adversarial search found
that the exact test fails at the up-rounded values 2.342e−3 and 1.462e−3, which an earlier
version printed.
